        HINDUISM

      <p class="lead">
        Hinduism is a diverse set of religious and spiritual traditions, originating in the Indian subcontinent, that share a core belief in dharma, a cosmic order maintained through righteous living and rituals. It encompasses a wide range of beliefs and practices, with no single founder, central authority, or binding holy book. Hinduism is often described as a "way of life" due to its emphasis on dharma and its influence on Indian culture and society.
